 		<p>Many dispute the origins of the 90s era of grimey and hardcore hip hop music which changed the whole outline of music for the rest of time. Some say it started due to the gang rilvalries between the Bloods and the Compton Crips, others just say it was due to people trying to be harder than they really were</p>
